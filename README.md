# Improved Laser Emitter Mod
This is my Improved Laser Emitter mod for the game [Besiege](http://www.besiege.spiderlinggames.co.uk/), forked from Pixali/advanced-optics

## Provides Abilities Below:
- Ignition(Seems not working on knights, not sure)
- Freeze(Only things that can freeze will freeze)
- Add Force
- Explosion(With some sort of charging effect)

## Provides settings below:
- Focus(Multiply this with the width will be the laser's end's width)
- Width
- Length
- Penetration Length Multiplier(Which means it can penetrate multiple objects)
- Color

## Provide abilities that are not change-able below:
- Can ignore Trigger Colliders. 
- Light(range depends on the width, intensity depends on the Penetration Length Multiplier, both depends on the bomb charge progress)
